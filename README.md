#MyGithub
A Github App for iPad I built in Swift as a personal side project.

#Capabilities

Note: GitHub API credentials are currently hard-coded into the source code. OAuth2 authentication with GitHub is currently not supported.
*Replace `Constants.token` with a new Github access token for API calls to work.*
